Columbia University	Harold Conklin	Ethnoecology began with some of the early works of Harold Conklin, a cognitive anthropologists who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia. In his 1954 dissertation ``The Relation of the Hanunoo Culture of the Plant World'' he coined the term ethnoecology when he described his approach as ``ethnoecological''. After earning his PhD he began teaching at Columbia University and continued his research among the Hanunoo. In 1955, Conklin published one of his first ethnoecological studies. His ``Hanunoo Color Categories'' study helped scholars understand the relationship between classification systems and conceptualization of the world within cultures. In this experiment, Conklin soon realized that people in various cultures recognized colors differently because of their unique classification system. Within his results he found that the Hanunoo uses two levels of colors. The first level consists of four basic terms of colors; darkness, lightness, redness, and greenness. The second level was more abstract and consisted of hundreds of color classifications; texture, shininess, and moisture of objects also were used to classify objects. Other anthropologists had a hard time understanding this color classification system because they often applied their own idea of color criteria the Hanunoo's color classifications. Conklin's studies were not only the breakthrough of ethnoecology, but they also helped develop the idea that other cultures conceptualize the world in their own terms, and helped to reduce ethnocentric views of those in western cultures. Other scholars such as Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven endeavored to learn more about other systems of environment classifications and to compare them to Western scientific taxonomies.	, a cognitive anthropologists who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia.

Technical University of Denmark	Canuto Kallan	Canuto Kallan is a visual artist, born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He studied painting and printmaking at the Athens School of Fine Arts, Greece. He holds a Master of Science in Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark and is trained as a cabinet-maker(awarded a Silver Medal for Woodworking). Canuto Kallan's art expresses nostalgia for the return to the primal instincts, the liberation from the constraints of reason and the importance of the very act of painting. His paintings are clearly an integrated part of the long tradition of Modernism, but they also reflect the environment in which he lives, in terms of place and time. His landscapes rendered with fragmented surfaces and complementary sharp colours reveal his studies on Paul Cézanne and the Cubists' analytical idiom, as well as mainly on Expressionism, and at the same time exhibit a tender lyricism through their rhythm. Landscapes painted with the aggressive brushstrokes of the Neue Wilden, commenting on reality with a subtle irony. The simplicity of his figures lends them liveliness and a rhythm which excites the viewers' eyes into a constant state of alertness and keeps their interest intact. Canuto Kallan's figures often convey strong messages of demonstration and social criticism and bring the viewer face to face with the harsh side of the contemporary human existence, the unbalanced, violent relation of humans with society, nature and themselves. The distortion of the shapes aims at revealing the essence of the matters and brings to light the corruption which prevails in today's human relations. He attempts, like the politically focused Asger Jorn, co-founder of some of the most important movements of the 20th century, like the CoBrA or Situationism to ground his art in life, having at the same time released it from the dark, demonic mysticism of the north. In Canuto Kallan's works the joy of creation comes to life through his spontaneity and imagination and the free and improvisational way in which he handles the medium. The colour which he handles in a dynamic way: gestural expression soaked by the fierce light of the Mediterranean and the gentleness of the idiosyncrasy of its world. It infiltrates into the unconscious depths of human existence and illuminates hard reality without passion and without destroying the human tinge and measure. Whether seen as a whole or separately, Canuto Kallan's multi-figural compositions create comparisons and cohesions, and obtain a narrative quality, but they also constitute autonomous creations with multiple ``readings''. Allegories and metaphors fuse with emotions that range from jubilation to anguish, transforming the painter's and the viewers personal experience into a universal possession.	 is a visual artist, born in Copenhagen, Denmark.

University of Vienna	Wilhelm Stekel	This discussion group was founded around Freud at the suggestion of the physician Wilhelm Stekel. Stekel had studied medicine at the University of Vienna under Richard von Krafft-Ebing. His conversion to psychoanalysis is variously attributed to his successful treatment by Freud for a sexual problem or as a result of his reading The Interpretation of Dreams, to which he subsequently gave a positive review in the Viennese daily newspaper Neues Wiener Tagblatt. The other three original members whom Freud invited to attend, Alfred Adler, Max Kahane, and Rudolf Reitler, were also physicians and all five were Jewish by birth. Both Kahane and Reitler were childhood friends of Freud. Kahane had attended the same secondary school and both he and Reitler went to university with Freud. They had kept abreast of Freud's developing ideas through their attendance at his Saturday evening lectures. In 1901, Kahane, who first introduced Stekel to Freud's work, had opened an out-patient psychotherapy institute of which he was the director in Bauernmarkt, in Vienna. In the same year, his medical textbook, Outline of Internal Medicine for Students and Practicing Physicians was published. In it, he provided an outline of Freud's psychoanalytic method. Kahane broke with Freud and left the Wednesday Psychological Society in 1907 for unknown reasons and in 1923 he committed suicide. Reitler was the director of an establishment providing thermal cures in Dorotheergasse which had been founded in 1901. He died prematurely in 1917. Adler, regarded as the most formidable intellect among the early Freud circle, was a socialist who in 1898 had written a health manual for the tailoring trade. He was particularly interested in the potential social impact of psychiatry. Max Graf, a Viennese musicologist and father of ``Little Hans'', who had first encountered Freud in 1900 and joined the Wednesday group soon after its initial inception, described the ritual and atmosphere of the early meetings of the society: The gatherings followed a definite ritual. First one of the members would present a paper. Then, black coffee and cakes were served; cigar and cigarettes were on the table and were consumed in great quantities. After a social quarter of an hour, the discussion would begin. The last and decisive word was always spoken by Freud himself. There was the atmosphere of the foundation of a religion in that room. Freud himself was its new prophet who made the heretofore prevailing methods of psychological investigation appear superficial. By 1906 the group had grown to sixteen members, including Otto Rank, who was employed as the group's paid secretary. Also in that year Freud began correspondence with Jung who was then an assistant to Eugen Bleuler at the Burghölzli Mental Hospital in Zurich. In March 1907 Jung and Ludwig Binswanger, also a Swiss psychiatrist, travelled to Vienna to visit Freud and attend the discussion group. Thereafter they established a small psychoanalytic group in Zurich. In 1908, reflecting its growing institutional status, the Wednesday group was renamed the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society.	.

University of Lethbridge	Myron Wolf Child	The Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada (APP) is a Canadian political party that was founded in 2005. Originally conceived by University of Lethbridge student Myron Wolf Child, the party held its founding meeting on August 21, 2005, in St. Albert, Alberta. The APP was headed by interim leader Bill Montour, a former Chief of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. In October 2005, the party had 122 confirmed members, just less than half the number needed to register as an official party in Canada. In late October 2005, the APP sought to unite with the First Peoples National Party of Canada which also had fewer than the number of confirmed members needed to become a registered political party. The First Peoples National Party of Canada became an eligible political party on December 6, 2005. Whether or not this was accomplished through a merger with the APP is still unclear. If this is the case, the APP no longer exists, but, as one of the stipulations of a possible merger was that a name for the new party would be determined at the party's first convention, it is possible that the name Aboriginal Peoples Party of Canada will come into usage again.	 student 	no

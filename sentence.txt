's approach to teaching was to liberate each individual to define a technical style of his or her own that should express their inner personality and give freedom to explore. She would tell her students, ``You have a perfect right to branch out, if you have the stuff in you, if you discover your own richness, if you have something to say.'' Holm's philosophy of teaching was how to find the essence of dance and understand where the movement comes from in the body that way it is a natural response in the dancer's body. She brought weltanschauung to her dance teaching. Holm was strict; she expected greatness from her students which would come from a willingness to work hard. It was her thought that if you worked hard and truly wanted it, you would achieve the desired outcome. Holm had an extremely keen eye, she had the ability to look at something and verbalize what she wanted using elaborate imagery and analogies. She used her technique class as a preparation for her improvisation and composition classes. These classes were where the students could expand and experiment on the skills that were presented in class, making the movement innate in their bodies. A large amount of Holm's choreography came from the improv and comp classes. Hanya Holm taught anatomy, Dalcroze eurhythmics, improvisation, and Labanotation at her school. She taught at .

 (March 1, 1924--August 3, 1993) was a Chilean writer, known since her earliest writings for the subversive nature of her texts. She first wrote La Brecha (``Breakthrough'') in 1961, which is considered to be the first feminist Latin-American novel. This novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. ``Breakthrough'' is a novel that ends with the heroine awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life. The book enjoyed an unexpected publishing success and went through five consecutive editions. Mercedes Valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. Valdivieso also was founder and director of ``Adan'' a Men's Magazine, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches. She taught literature at the University of Peking, at the University of Houston, at .

 and served in the Canadian Army in World War I. Fogo was called to the Nova Scotia bar in 1924 and practised law in Halifax. He married Helen Louise Fisher in 1927. Fogo was a vice-president and director for Algoma Steel. While making a name for himself in corporate law, he was also active in the Liberal Party, where he became a protégé of William Lyon Mackenzie King. He was appointed co-chairman of the Third National Convention of the Liberal Party in 1948. Reporting this appointment, Time magazine characterized him as ``a reliable worker behind the scenes, whose political gift is to stop bootless quarreling and secure quiet settlements''. Fogo was summoned to the Canadian Senate in 1949, and represented the senatorial division of Carleton, Ontario. Impressed by his relative youth and energy a contemporary newspaper editorialized, ``what the Senate needs is fewer old fogeys and more young Fogos!'' Nevertheless, he died in office in La Malbaie, Quebec just three years later, in 1952. Fogo was survived by his wife (b. 1900) and two children.

During his thirty-eight year career in public service, Fowler was the Foreign Policy Advisor to Prime Ministers Trudeau, Turner and Mulroney; Deputy Minister of National Defence; Canada's longest serving Ambassador to the United Nations. While at the UN, he represented Canada on the Security Council in 1999 and 2000 and issued two ground-breaking reports on sanctions-busting in Angola, which cut off UNITA's access to the arms bazaar and led to the end of the civil war which had ravaged Angola for 25 years. He was also Ambassador to Italy and the three Rome-based UN food agencies; Sherpa for the Kananaskis G8 Summit (for which he chaired the creation of the Africa Action Plan); and the personal representative for Africa of Prime Ministers Chrétien, Martin and Harper. .

, where she met a talented artist, Dorothy Hepworth, who became her lifelong companion. With the help of Hepworth's wealthy family, they set up a home and studio together. Both studied drawing with Henry Tonks. Preece's early work was praised by Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant and Roger Fry. In the early 1920s, they lived mostly in Paris to continue their art studies, Preece studying principally with André Lhote. There, they were influenced by the lesbian art world of Natalie Barney's salon. Upon their return to London in 1925, however, they tried to avoid the opprobrium suffered by open lesbians and often claimed to be sisters. They became more involved with the Bloomsbury Group, some of the members of which they had met earlier. They spent summer holidays in Wales or Cornwall where Patricia was again rescued from drowning, this time by a local mineworker. Preece had a reputation for happily accepting casual flirtations from admirers, only to reject them when they became more serious. In 1928, Preece and Hepworth moved to Cookham, living in a cottage purchased by Hepworth's parents. The gregarious Preece signed many of the shy Hepworth's paintings and negotiated with dealers to exhibit and sell the work as Preece's, fooling many in the art world, including the artist Augustus John, who declared Preece one of the six greatest women artists in England. In 1929, Preece met Cookham artist Stanley Spencer and his artist wife, Hilda Carline, while she was substituting as a waitress in a teashop in Cookham. Preece and Hepworth became friendly with Spencer and his wife, sometimes minding their daughters and joining their art picnics. Carline's brother Richard was attracted and took Preece dining and dancing, until he understood the nature of her relationship with Hepworth. The Hepworths lost their fortune in the Great Depression, and from 1930, Preece and Hepworth were struggling to make mortgage payments. Spencer introduced Preece to his extensive art-world contacts. In May 1933, Spencer's cosmopolitan patron, Edward Beddington-Behrens invited Patricia to travel with Stanley to Switzerland for a commission (Preece spoke fluent French, while Stanley spoke none). In 1933, Preece first modelled for Spencer, sitting for Portrait of .

His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but dropped the first names Lily Mary shortly after she was married and changed her name to Marelle. Flynn described his mother's family as ``seafaring folk'' and this appears to be where his life-long interest in boats and the sea originated. Despite Flynn's claims, the evidence indicates that he was not descended from any of the Bounty mutineers. Married at St John's Church of England, Balmain North, Sydney, on 23 January 1909, both of his parents were native-born Australians of Irish, English and Scottish descent, with convict links to Tasmania long before Flynn's birth.

Professor Kaptein received two student-based teaching awards during his career at CU: the 2007 Marius Smith Award (CU Parents Association) and the 1998 Residential Life Teaching Award (Office of Campus Residential Life). Under his leadership, CU choirs distinguished themselves through juried performances at both national and divisional conventions of the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA), made four concert tours to Europe - being awarded third prize at the Tolosa International Choral Festival in 1992, appeared at numerous conventions of the Colorado Music Educators Convention, and made many in-state tours with University ensembles. The performance of the University Choir at the 1991 National ACDA Convention in Phoenix, AZ has frequently been cited as the genesis of the multi-cultural choral movement in the United States. That convention appearance, which included several African folksongs (incorporating movement and use of authentic percussion instruments,) was a programming approach that had previously never been tried at a national choral convention. Kaptein remains a champion of ethnic choral literature, contemporary American works, and the much-overlooked secular choral repertoire. He has published articles (primarily dealing with rehearsal pedagogy and American choral history) in the ``Choral Journal,'' ``American Choral Review'' and was a contributor to ``An Annotated Listing of Distinctive High School Choral Repertoire'' published by the American Choral Directors Association. His ``List of Ethnically-Inspired Choral Repertoire'' has appeared in numerous state and regional choral publications over the years. During his seventeen-year tenure as Artistic Director of the CU's annual 'Holiday Festival' (formerly the 'Festival of Christmas'), weekend audience size grew to well over 8,000 patrons. The content of the program also began to broaden in scope emphasizing the inclusion of various holiday traditions and diverse seasonal repertoire. This event has now become a major financial resource (primarily funding music scholarships) for the College of Music. Kaptein received degrees from .

This novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. ``Breakthrough'' is a novel that ends with the heroine awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life.

Mercedes Valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. Valdivieso also was founder and director of ``Adan'' a Men's Magazine, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches.

 in Skokie, Illinois and studied film at Columbia College Chicago. He started shooting super 8 short Six Million Dollar Man movies when he was only eight years old. He completed his first feature horror film, Short Cut Road in 2003 which was distributed by horror movie outlet Sub Rosa Studios on DVD in 2003, quickly followed by The Rockville Slayer in 2004, which was distributed by Freestyle Home Entertainment and Universal UMVD. The Rockville Slayer had horror genre actors Joe Estevez, Linnea Quigley, and Robert Z'Dar star in the film. In 2006, he was set to shoot his third feature, Satanic Panic, but had to push back production until 2007 due to time constraints. Because of the shooting delay, some parts had to be recast, including roles originally set to star veteran B-movie actesses Felissa Rose and Brinke Stevens. The final cast consists of mostly Chicago based actors. The film is loosely based on the ``satanic cult'' killings that occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. Satanic Panic began filming in the summer of 2007 with most principal photography completed in September. The remaining scenes were finally shot in June and July 2008. Marc has jokingly referred to Satanic as ``the Star Wars of low budget horror movies'' because of the time it took to complete. Marc stated, ``Karl (co-writer Karl Sundstrom) and I started writing Satanic in September/October of 2005. Three years in the making because Satanic finished production in the fall of 2008.'' Satanic Panic was initially planned as a straight to DVD project, but there is word of a potential limited theatrical release due to industry buzz about the film. The film was screened on November 28, 2008 in Wheeling, IL for friends, family and some press. In late 2008 a mask distribution deal of the creature ``Toby'' from the fim Satanic Panic was made between .

 (March 1, 1924--August 3, 1993) was a Chilean writer, known since her earliest writings for the subversive nature of her texts. She first wrote La Brecha (``Breakthrough'') in 1961, which is considered to be the first feminist Latin-American novel. This novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. ``Breakthrough'' is a novel that ends with the heroine awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life. The book enjoyed an unexpected publishing success and went through five consecutive editions. Mercedes Valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. Valdivieso also was founder and director of ``Adan'' a Men's Magazine, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches.
